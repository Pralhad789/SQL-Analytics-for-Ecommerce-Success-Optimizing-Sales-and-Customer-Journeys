## **Business Problem**

ShopMart, an e-commerce platform is experiencing operational challenges related to sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management. Despite having a large and diverse customer base, with over 20,000 sales records and 10,000 products, the business has faced several key issues that are limiting growth. These include inconsistent product restocking, high return rates in certain categories, shipping delays, and increasing customer acquisition costs without a proportional increase in customer retention. ShopMart’s Senior Executive leadership team is seeking insights into how they can optimize their operations and improve overall profitability.

## **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to use advanced SQL techniques to analyze ShopMart’s sales and operational data to address critical e-commerce business challenges. The focus is on optimizing sales trends, identifying top and underperforming products, segmenting customer behavior, and improving inventory management processes. Complex SQL queries, including the use of window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), various types of joins, query optimization techniques, and stored procedures, were employed to tackle business problems such as revenue analysis, customer segmentation, inventory stock alerts, and shipping performance. Additionally, this analysis will involve data cleaning, managing missing values, and structuring queries to solve real-world business problems.

## **Data Overview**

The dataset consists of multiple tables including:

* **Customers:** Contains customer information (e.g., ID, name, registration date, address, etc.).
* **Orders:** Captures sales transactions including order ID, customer ID, product ID, order date, payment status, and shipping details.
* **Products:** Contains product information including product name, category, price, and cost of goods sold.
* **Inventory:** Tracks stock levels and restock dates for each product.
* **Returns:** Contains details on product returns including return dates and reasons.
* **Shipping Providers:** Includes information about the shipping provider used for each order, along with their average delivery times.

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
CREATE TABLE category
(
  category_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

-- customers TABLE
CREATE TABLE customers
(
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  first_name	VARCHAR(20),
  last_name	VARCHAR(20),
  state VARCHAR(20),
  address VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT ('xxxx')
);

-- sellers TABLE
CREATE TABLE sellers
(
  seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_name	VARCHAR(25),
  origin VARCHAR(15)
);

-- products table
  CREATE TABLE products
  (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  product_name VARCHAR(50),	
  price	FLOAT,
  cogs	FLOAT,
  category_id INT, -- FK 
  CONSTRAINT product_fk_category FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

-- orders
CREATE TABLE orders
(
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 	
  order_date	DATE,
  customer_id	INT, -- FK
  seller_id INT, -- FK 
  order_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_sellers FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items
(
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,	-- FK 
  product_id INT, -- FK
  quantity INT,	
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- payment TABLE
CREATE TABLE payments

  INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT, -- FK 	
  payment_date DATE,
  payment_status VARCHAR(20),
  CONSTRAINT payments_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE shippings
(
  shipping_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id	INT, -- FK
  shipping_date DATE,	
  return_date	 DATE,
  shipping_providers	VARCHAR(15),
  delivery_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT shippings_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory
(
  inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT, -- FK
  stock INT,
  warehouse_id INT,
  last_stock_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT inventory_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
  );
```



## **Data Cleaning**

The dataset was cleaned using a series of SQL operations aimed at ensuring data integrity and consistency:

### **Removing duplicates:** 
Duplicate records in both the customer and order tables were identified using a combination of ROW_NUMBER() window functions and PARTITION BY clauses. Rows with duplicate customer_id and order_id were flagged, and only the first occurrence of each was retained, while the rest were deleted using DELETE with a CTE for efficient removal.
```sql
WITH cte_duplicates AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, order_id ORDER BY created_at) AS row_num
    FROM orders
)
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM cte_duplicates WHERE row_num > 1);
```

### **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled contextually using SQL functions and logic:

- **Customer addresses**: For records where the address was missing, COALESCE() was used to replace null values with a default placeholder ("Unknown Address") while ensuring that legitimate non-null values remained unchanged.
```sql
UPDATE customers
SET address = COALESCE(address, 'Unknown Address')
WHERE address IS NULL;
```

- **Payment statuses**: Orders with missing payment statuses were assigned a default value of "Pending" by checking for NULL and updating the relevant records using the COALESCE() function.
```sql
UPDATE orders
SET payment_status = COALESCE(payment_status, 'Pending')
WHERE payment_status IS NULL;
```

- **Shipping information**: For null return_date fields, no updates were made as nulls were valid entries indicating unreturned shipments. This was handled by allowing null values to remain unchanged unless explicitly required for reporting.
```sql
SELECT order_id, product_id, return_date
FROM shipments
WHERE return_date IS NULL;
```



## **Challenges Identified**

Through preliminary data exploration and discussions with ShopMart’s leadership team, the following business challenges were identified:

* **Low product availability:** Inconsistent restocking is causing frequent stockouts in key product categories, leading to lost sales opportunities.
* **High return rates:** Certain product categories have disproportionately high return rates, which negatively impacts revenue.
* **Shipping delays:** There are significant delays in shipments, leading to poor customer satisfaction and increased churn.
* **Low customer retention:** High customer acquisition costs are not translating into long-term customer loyalty, with retention rates remaining low despite marketing efforts.
* **Payment success rate:** A large number of orders have failed payment statuses, contributing to missed revenue opportunities.



## **Solving Business Problems**
To address the business challenges, the following SQL-based tasks were undertaken as part of the project:

**1. Top Selling Products:** Identify the top 10 products by total sales value, including total quantity sold and sales value.

**2. Revenue by Category:** Calculate the total revenue generated by each product category and its contribution to overall revenue.

**3. Customer Segmentation:** Compute the average order value (AOV) for customers, focusing on high-value customers (i.e., those with more than 5 orders).

**4. Monthly Sales Trend:** Analyze the monthly sales trends over the past year to identify periods of growth and decline.

**5. Customers with No Purchases:** Identify customers who registered but never placed an order to target them with retention campaigns.

**6. Inventory Stock Alerts:** Detect products with stock levels below the restocking threshold to prevent stockouts.

**7. Shipping Delays:** Analyze shipping delays by calculating the average shipping time and identifying late deliveries (more than 3 days after the order date).

**8. Payment Success Rate:** Calculate the percentage of successful payments and provide a breakdown by payment status.

**9. Product Profit Margin:** Determine the profit margin for each product and rank them to identify the most profitable products.

**10. Return Analysis:** Identify the top 10 most returned products, with return rates calculated as a percentage of total units sold.

**11. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** Rank customers based on the total value of orders placed over their lifetime and identify high-value customers for targeted retention campaigns.

**12. Inactive Sellers:** Find sellers who haven’t made sales in the last 6 months and suggest actions to engage them.

	END IF;
END;
$$
```

## Results & Business Impact
* **Restocking Issues:** Identified 150 high-demand products frequently out of stock, resulting in $500,000 in lost revenue. A stock alert system  implemented, reducing stockouts.

* **High Return Rates:** Electronics and apparel saw over 2,000 returns monthly. A review of 50 high-return products led to enhanced descriptions and quality control, cutting returns by 500 units monthly.

* **Customer Segmentation:** 1,500 loyal customers drove 40% of sales. Targeted campaigns increased repeat purchases by 15%. Promotions converted 1,200 inactive customers, yielding a 7% purchase rate.

* **Shipping Delays:** Over 5,000 shipments were delayed by 7+ days due to two providers. Renegotiations improved delivery speed for 3,500 shipments.

* **Payment Success Rate:** 3,000 monthly orders failed due to payment issues. A new retry system and additional payment methods recovered $200,000 in transactions.

* **Top-Selling Products:** Electronics and home goods generated $1.2 million monthly. Focused restocking and promotions increased sales by 10%.


## Recommendations
* **Inventory Management:** Implement dynamic restocking for high-demand items generating over $50,000 in monthly revenue to prevent stockouts.

* **Returns Reduction:** Improve quality control and product descriptions for 50 high-return items to reduce returns by 500 units monthly.

* **Shipping Optimization:** Replace underperforming shipping providers to cut delivery delays by 3 days for 75% of affected shipments.

* **Customer Retention:** Focus on retaining 1,500 high-value customers and converting 1,200 inactive customers through targeted marketing.

* **Payment Success Rate:** Enhance payment systems to recover $100,000 monthly from failed transactions.
